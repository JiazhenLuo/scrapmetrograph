    "year": "1989",
    "runtime": "106min",
    "synopsis": "Adapted from South African André Brink’s novel of the same name, Palcy’s fierce drama—the first Hollywood studio film directed by a Black woman (and only her second feature)—stars Donald Sutherland as a schoolteacher at a whites-only school in mid-1970s South Africa who, following the brutal beating of his gardener’s (Winston Ntshona) activist son by the police, finds himself increasingly opposed to fighting the apartheid system, enlisting the aide of sympathetic journalist Susan Sarandon and anti-apartheid lawyer Marlon Brando, returning to the screen for the first time in a decade with focus and fiery commitment. Impressed by Palcy's commitment to human rights, Brando originally wanted to work for free but had to accept the union rate. “First-rate agitprop about the ruthlessness of South African apartheid… The relentless plot is effectively set up and expertly pursued.” —Jonathan Rosenbaum, The Chicago Reader",

    "runtime": "130min",
    "synopsis": "Serpents abound in the lush garden that is boomtown 1930s Los Angeles in Polanski’s neo-noir classic from a razor-sharp script by native Angelino Robert Towne, starring Jack Nicholson as an amiably sleazy P.I. and all-around nosey guy who get much more than he bargained for when he takes a job from woman-in-trouble Faye Dunaway and discovers a conspiracy to steal water rights masterminded by proudly corrupt plutocrat John Huston. Sam O’Steen, who’d earlier worked with Polanski on Rosemary’s Baby—the director would say of O’Steen that he had “a skill and imagination that takes my breath away”—would receive one of the film’s 11 Academy Award nominations, his work at the editing table a major factor in the film’s captivating, can’t-look-away grip.",

    "synopsis": "All-American hillbilly hunk Joe Buck (Jon Voight) leaves Texas for New York City in search of his big break, only to quickly find himself a flat-broke hustler whose only friend is a loudmouth, tubercular con man named Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) who’s even more on the skids than Buck is. A deeply affecting and justly celebrated actors’ duet as well as a time capsule of late-’60s Times Square and downtown bohemia that still speaks volumes about the dirty business of eking out a living in a loud, ugly city that doesn’t know you’re alive and doesn’t care if you die. The first DP credit on a feature for Polish-born cinematographer Adam Holender, whose effective distillation of the essence of down-and-out NYC in bone-chilling winter doubtlessly led to his hiring onto 1971’s Panic in Needle Park.",

    "synopsis": "Before going on to international success with 1996 romantic comedy Shall We Dance? Suo began his career in Roman porno, his first feature a barbed spoof of the family dramas of Yasujiro Ozu—replete with “pillow shots,” tatami mat-level camera placements, and Ren Osugi doing a spot-on impression of Chishu Ryu—in which Ozu’s frequent theme of almost symbiotic closeness between parents and children is pushed towards intimations of incestuous desire. A perverse mash note to Golden Age Japanese cinema from the twilight of the Roman porno, which by the mid-’80s was facing stiff competition from home video.",

    "synopsis": "Where its predecessor was a slow-burn suspenser, Cameron’s Aliens is a bombastic, no-holds-barred exosuit fight to the finish, an express elevator to hell, goin’ down! Lone survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) goes back for a rematch with the creatures who slaughtered the crew of the Nostromo, this time bringing along a squad of hard-boiled space marines whose number includes the great Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein, and Lance Henriksen’s mumblety-peg-playing android Bishop. Rounding out the superb supporting players are the aliens themselves, pinnacles of pre-CGI visual effects that just keep coming, and coming, and coming, and coming… while Mead’s contributions can mostly be seen in the blade-like military vessel Sulaco and the unforgettable “Power Loader” donned by Ripley for the main event grudge match.",

At once funny and shattering, Manuela’s journey is a paean to femininity in every form. An Oscar winner and massive across the board hit that brought Almodóvar mainstream acceptance.",

Hard and tender, this may be Haneke’s ultimate accomplishment—and, incidentally, a eulogy for the youthful dreams of the 1960s European art cinema.",

An outrageous, rabble-rousing contribution to the Roman Porno redux series, its action largely confined to a single set, Anti-Porno contains plenty of sex but above all is a world-class mindfuck, an expectation-defying, antic study in blighted eroticism, damaged psyches, and shifting power dynamics, set against outlandishly theatrical backdrops.",

In this edition, join us in unpacking an entire chest full of delightful vintage baubles and knickknacks, including the all-toy cast of Charles and Ray Eames’s Traveling Boy, the sweet show-and-tell session of Satyajit Ray’s Two, the Russian nesting dolls of Co Hoedeman’s Matrioska, and the acrobatic marionettes of Hoedeman’s Marianne’s Theatre.

An examination of the difficult relationship between religious submission and sexual liberation, featuring some of the most memorable foley sounds in recent cinema.",

    "synopsis": "Street casting Lee Kang-sheng after seeing him minding the door at a Taipei arcade, Tsai gave the untrained actor a major role in this 1991 telefilm, a pivotal work that finds Tsai balancing the established tenets of social realism with his emerging experimental bent, in which Lee plays a young working-class man who shakes down a rather more posh contemporary (Liu Jixin) in order to get money for a hospitalized friend. Screens with My Stinking Kid, a drama about a sickly boy bullied by his peers because the medication he takes makes him stink of ammonia, co-credited to Lee and Tsai, and Lee’s Single Belief, in which the actor/director appears, chicly attired for a change, posing in Taipei’s bustling, fashionable Ximending district.",

    "synopsis": "In undertaking his remake of Val Lewton/Jacques Tourneur’s 1942 Cat People, Schrader, fresh from the high-style success of American Gigolo, drenched the material in druggy-delirious ’80s excess, including a Giorgio Moroder synth score (with David Bowie-sung theme), lavish production design by Ferdinando Scarfiotti (credited as “Visual Consultant”), and Nastassja Kinski at the height of her androgynous glamor. Kinski plays a young woman newly arrived in New Orleans to reunite with long lost older brother Malcolm McDowell, only there to discover during visits to the zoo (and through a burgeoning relationship with zookeeper John Heard) that she’s inherited her family’s unusual affinity for large, predatory cats… Tawdry, transgressive, and transcendent filmmaking.",

    "synopsis": "The actual Chinatown neighborhood in Los Angeles doesn’t play a major role in Polanski’s noir-inflected film of dirty dealings in 1930s Southern California, but it does a whole lot of metaphorical heavy lifting in the film’s famous kicker line, symbolic of a place where the rules and the language are beyond comprehension. Faye Dunaway is a woman in trouble; Jack Nicholson is the nosey detective Jake Gittes who thinks he can get her out of it; and John Huston is the vilest plutocrat in all of cinema, reshaping the future of a thriving city with concern only for fattening his pockets. Native Angelino Robert Towne’s screenplay is perhaps his finest, an indictment of the conscienceless concerns that, in his hometown’s years of golden promise, were already silently steering its fate.",

Wong’s international breakthrough introduced new audiences to his rich, sensorial brand of filmmaking, inviting one to disappear into, sink into, live inside, a voluptuary world bigger and brighter than our own—but just as heartbreaking.",

Contains Smith’s finest foul-mouthed arias of dialogue, many of these interpreted by Jason Mewes’s gravel-voiced Jay. (“He speaks some English, but he cannot speak it good like we do.”)",

Arriving in an afterlife metropolis where the deceased go on trial to see if they’ve learned enough to stay on in paradise or are due for another lesson via reincarnation, our hero has to cringingly revisit his ignoble existence, the outcome of his review becoming suddenly desperate when he falls for Meryl Streep, a fellow casualty who’s lived a far more exemplary life—meaning that defense lawyer Rip Torn has his work cut out for him if our hero is to get the girl.",

Prep school headmaster Paul Meurisse’s reign of terror over his two colleagues/lovers—history teacher Simone Signoret and his frail wife, played by Mme. Véra Clouzot—comes to a close after a conspiracy between the two women that ends in him getting his just deserts. But when the dirty deed is done, and the two women find their victim’s body seems to have disappeared, that’s when the real psychological torment begins…",

Lushly swathed in period tunes and featuring, in the form of Patrick Swayze, an impeccable period performer.",

A lucid dramatization of how corruption spread through the entire ecosystem around America’s pastime, handsomely lensed by cinematographer Robert Richardson and boasting a once-in-a-lifetime ensemble cast that puts Sayles regulars like David Strathairn and Gordon Clapp alongside rising stars John Cusack and Charlie Sheen.",

An intoxicating swansong, and an apt end to a career defined by an ongoing tango between Eros and Thanatos.",

    "synopsis": "The first film adaptation from the work of cartoonist Daniel Clowes, Ghost World is a post-apocalyptic survival film set in the suburban AnyAmerica of 2001. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson co-star as two too-smart girls using caustic wit to shield themselves from the toxic effects of living in a cultural wasteland, discovering an amiably creepy kindred spirit in the form of Steve Buscemi’s weedy record collector. A modern-day comic classic, and an anthem for opting out.",

A comprehensive catalog of classic Haneke motifs (surveillance, barely sublimated racism, inter-generational resentment, guilt as a gnawing cancer), its various moving parts kept whirring by Willi, whose mastery of the ellipsis as a tension-building tool has rarely been shown to better advantage. “As gripping as a satanically inspired soap opera… A black comedy of pure sociopathy.” —The Guardian",

A spare and immensely empathetic portrait of the alienation inherent to much of contemporary urban life—and the cold-comfort options on the market for its relief—with strikingly squalid neon-splashed production design courtesy Tsai Ming-liang.",

    "synopsis": "The rising waters that seep through Tsai Ming-Liang’s filmography seem not only a powerful metaphor for a rising tide of desire, but a disturbingly relevant vision of global inundation. Returning to Malaysia, his birthplace, Tsai creates an aching drama, touched by an ambient sense of disaster, concerning a brutally beaten homeless man and the young Bangladeshi guest worker who finds him and nurtures him back to health. Exploring the marginal lives of immigrant communities in Southeast Asia, Tsai makes potent usage of Kuala Lumpur locations, including, to stunning effect, an enormous, flooded construction site.",

Written by them both and drawing heavily on Hernandez’s relationship with her alternative health doctor/public television personality/eccentric physician father, Hernandez plays Carrie, a young woman who, in the wake of her father’s death—Hernandez’s actual late father, seen in vintage footage—explores his complicated legacy, including the patent for an innovative healing machine that appears to actually work. A captivating meta-cinematic rumination on grief and the concept of original authorship with a dry, cracked sense of humor, and a film in which the unexpected lurks behind every corner.",

    "synopsis": "Van Dijl’s tense, artfully understated feature debut, which made a splash at last year’s Cannes in the Critics’ Week section, is a drama of startling revelations and telling silences set at an elite youth tennis academy in Belgium that’s rocked by the suicide of a female pupil, in the aftermath of which many enrollees begin to speak out about the behavior of one particular coach (Laurent Caron)… while his star pupil Julie (real-life competitive tennis player Tessa Van den Broeck, in her first film role) remains conspicuously close-lipped. A psychological drama made with keen insight into the motives behind confession and suppression, with the unusual distinction of having both the Dardenne brothers, Florian Zeller, and Naomi Osaka among its producers.",

Karina gives a performance of radiant fortitude as Suzanne Simonin, a young woman consigned by her family to take up the nun’s habit in spite of a lack of religious avocation, struggling to keep her faith and basic humanity intact while subjected to the capricious cruelty of higher-ups including Micheline Presle’s sadistic Mother Superior.",

A great American movie… The best work yet by one of our most original and independent filmmakers.” —Roger Ebert, The Chicago Sun-Times",

A tour-de-force by Roman porno mainstay Kumashiro, distinguished by finely shaded character studies, dynamic camerawork, self-censorship by Brakhage-esque emulsion-scratching, and a robust sense of the absurd, Lovers are Wet shows just how much was possible within the genre confines of the pink film.",

A film of enormous pathos and easygoing humor which won Masina Best Actress honors at Cannes and gave a young Pier Paolo Pasolini an early screen credit, hired by Fellini for his intimate knowledge of the argot of Roman streets. “Fellini’s finest film.” —Pauline Kael, The New Yorker",

Guerra co-wrote the script with Tarkovsky, who had been—with Antonioni—one of the witnesses at the screenwriter’s 1977 wedding in Moscow, and with whom he had earlier hoped to collaborate on a film (unmade, alas) to be shot in Uzbekistan.",

Running in a new 4K restoration, with Solondz and cast and crew appearing in-person for a 20th Anniversary reunion screening. “Brave and challenging. The film has no heroes without flaws and no villains without virtues… Each individual story has an authenticity and impact of its own.” —Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times",

Through the course of Bergman’s stark, startling, boundary-busting psychodrama—the movie he referred to as “a breakthrough”—however, their personalities and images seem to merge, until the dividing lines between them practically disappear. Troublingly erotic, lensed with bleak beauty by cinematographer Sven Nykvist, and filled with new stylistic gambits from Bergman, including a famous moment in which the heat of emotion onscreen seems to destroy the film itself.",

Anticipating the lavish fantasias of Pierre et Gilles and arguably outdoing them, Bidgood’s newly restored lone feature, obsessive and intoxicating, is nothing less than “a benchmark of underground gay cinema.” [The New York Times]",

Lush, mesmerizing, and confounding, existing in a fog-shrouded territory where memory, fantasy, and present-tense reality mingle, Reygadas’s divisive psychic self-portrait may be judged a triumph or a folly, but will leave no viewer indifferent.",

A warm, vibrant, and infinitely charming tale of loss and (literally) supernatural perseverance, featuring a cast loaded with top tier talent from the Francophone Caribbean, including legendary Guadeloupe group Kassav’, Pascal Légitimus of the French trio of humorists Les Inconnus, and jazz pianist Alain Jean-Marie. Presented in a stunning 4K restoration and now widely considered Palcy's masterpiece, after the triumph of her sophomore feature A Dry White Season, which made her the first Black woman director to have a film produced by a major Hollywood studio.",

    "synopsis": "Cancelled after three seasons in 1969, Gene Roddenberry’s cult NBC series Star Trek only gained more and more rabid fans in its syndication afterlife, leading to its resurrection a decade later in this first big-screen outing for the crew of the starship Enterprise, recruited here to intercept a mysterious energy cloud barreling toward Earth and leaving a swath of destruction in its path as it does. To design the marauding vessel discovered travelling inside the cloud, the alien-piloted “V’ger,” Mead, in his first piece of film concept art, worked with Roddenberry, Wise, and FX maestro Douglas Trumbull to help design what would become the 68’ V’ger model used on the shoot, following Wise’s directive to create something “no man had ever seen.”",

    "synopsis": "Often overlooked in surveys of Linklater’s career, SubUrbia, his first film not from an original screenplay, adapted by Eric Bogosian from his stage play of the same name, is a work of enormous empathy and gets-under-your-skin melancholy, taking place over the course of a single night in the environs of a Texas convenience store where five twentysomething friends’ (Giovanni Ribisi, Amie Carey, Steve Zahn, Nicky Katt, Dina Spybey) nightly routine of shooting the shit is interrupted by the appearance of up-and-coming rocker Jayce Bartok and pushy publicist Parker Posey. The darkest of its director’s “hang out” movies, faintly pulsing with the ambient dread that comes of living in a landscape of superstores and subdivisions.",

The spare, philosophical script marks Guerra’s second collaboration with Angelopoulos, their partnership lasting until the deaths of both men in 2012.",

Unique in its examination of war guilt as experienced from a distance of two generations, Albert’s historical excavation drama is lent considerable momentum through Fischer’s live-wire performance, Willi’s reliably spry cutting, and Lorenz Dangel’s score.",

Priests Max von Sydow and Jason Miller, the latter in a performance of gloomy grandeur, are called on to cast a demon out of a Georgetown townhouse, and find themselves staring down pure evil.",

An existential epic on the Cecil B. DeMille scale for the psychedelic set, in which Jodorowsky is given free rein to realize his most fantastic imaginings.",

Featuring appearances by countercultural figures like poet Sakumi Hagiwara and activist/dancer Genshu Hanayagi, as well as freewheeling formal and stylistic experimentation, The Oldest Profession is among the boldest and most uncompromised of Roman Porno titles.",

Influential for both revivifying the then-moribund Korean horror film and injecting it with a new streak of comic cruelty, The Quiet Family has been loosely remade—by Takashi Miike, for one—but arguably never topped for gruesome glee.",

A mesmerizing, gentle work of magic realism which, set in the 1940s, as industrialization has made inroads into even rural Ireland, old traditions are fading, and the equilibrium of the natural world is upset, also feels perfectly aligned to Sayles’s recurring thematic concerns.",

    "synopsis": "One of the most accomplished directorial debuts of the 1990s, Coppola’s adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides’s novel tells the story of five death-haunted teenaged siblings in a posh Detroit suburb, the Lisbon sisters, by way of a swooning sensorial immersion in the very textures and languorous rhythms of suburban privilege and anguished innocence. Electronic duo Air provide the pillowy dreamscape soundtrack, while Kirsten Dunst—then emerging as one of the most exciting young American actresses working—anchors the central quintet.",

    "synopsis": "Never an artist to stay in one place for long, Tsai followed what had been perhaps his most austere film to-date, 2003’s eulogistic Goodbye, Dragon Inn, with this trashy-glammy borderline pornographic provocation, filled with strikingly staged musical set pieces and inspired acts of desperate deviancy. Lee Kang-sheng returns in the role of Hsiao-kang, now working as a porn actor, reunited with his missed connection from Tsai’s 2001 What Time is it There?, genuine feeling struggling to flourish in a landscape of cold, commodified desire. Boasts the most memorable uses of a watermelon of the many in Tsai’s films, and musical interludes evoking both Busby Berkeley and Kander and Ebb, the latter in Lu Yi-ching’s jaw-dropping “Spider Woman” number.",

Evan Rachel Wood plays Tracy, a Los Angeles honor student who strays from the straight-and-narrow path under the influence of new juvenile delinquent bestie Evie (Reed), much to the dismay of her recently divorced recovering alcoholic mother Holly Hunter. A blunt-scented plunge into the lower depths of the Valley, a time capsule of early aughts youth culture, and a showcase for second-skin natural performances by Wood, Reed, and Hunter.",

Haneke’s lacerating, under-seen portrayal of civilizational collapse, a bellwether for the cinema’s all-consuming 21st-century obsession with dystopia, utilizes a splintering narrative structure—handled with effortless aplomb by Willi, in her second of six collaborations to-date with Haneke—rooted firmly in the director’s obsessions with the fragility of the family unit. “A frighteningly potent glimpse into the abyss… One of the most harrowing and plausible visions of apocalypse since… Night of the Living Dead.” —Manohla Dargis, Los Angeles Times",

A delirious, audacious, and always unpredictable genre-bender that fuses parent-child melodrama, cyberpunk sci-fi, and serial killer movie shocker in a maverick film fable that’s as emotional as it is visceral.",

Nominated for six Academy Awards, including a Best Editing nomination for Monika Willi, with whom Field spent long, secluded hours cutting the film at a 15th-century former nunnery outside Edinburgh, Scotland. “The biggest challenge,” Willi would say of the process, “was the overall musicality… To have one big piece made of a lot of smaller pieces and see that it never lost its tension.”",

A disarmingly funny masterclass in less-is-more storytelling economy that is, in its final scene in the then-unfinished Daan Forest Park, utterly devastating.",

    "synopsis": "A key entry in Tsai’s Walker series, inspired by the 16th-century Chinese literature classic of the same name and the long overland journey that it describes, Journey to the West—like all of the Walker films—features Lee Kang-sheng as a Buddhist monk in a saffron robe walking at an almost imperceptibly slow pace against the backdrop of a busy cityscape. Here the city is Marseille, where Lee will be joined by a traveling companion of sorts, the great French actor (and trained mime) Denis Lavant. A meditative, curiously absorbing, and quietly glorious work. Screens with No No Sleep, a singular variation on the Walker concept, which begins with Lee’s monk crossing Tokyo and ends with a brief, loaded encounter at a day spa between Lee (perhaps or perhaps not the same character) and Ando Masanobu.",

Enormously moving, while nimbly sidestepping cliché and cloying sentiment, and a paean to the natural beauty of the Whangara landscape. “Not a simplistic fable but the story of real people living in modern times… [Castle-Hughes] is a movie star. She glows.”—Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times",

A mordantly funny film on the topics of grief, longing, female flâneurism, death, and rebirth, featuring some of Tsai’s most exquisitely composed durational sequence shots.",

    "synopsis": "First screened as two separate 2022 films, Rimini and Sparta, following the lives of two long-separated brothers, the diptych Wicked Games: Rimini Sparta brings together the stories of Richie, a long-at-the-tooth crooner who sells romantic fantasy and sexual favors to his elderly fans at an off-season Adriatic resort town; Ewald, a technician-cum-judo teacher living in Romania who wrestles quietly with pedophiliac desires; and their dementia-addled father, spending his second childhood pottering around an Austrian nursing home. An epic, bleak vision of innocence and soiled experience, in which editor Monika Willi moves on from no frame before it has left its mark nor allows any to linger past the point where it has nothing to add.",

    "title": "Winter Light",
    "director": "Ingmar  Bergman",
    "year": "1963",
    "runtime": "81min",
    "synopsis": "His flock dwindling, his perfunctory performance of his duties now guided by muscle memory alone, small town pastor Tomas’s (Gunnar Björnstrand) slow loss of faith arrives at a moment of actual crisis when he is called to ease the torment of a parishioner (Max von Sydow) paralyzed by fear of the atomic bomb, for whom he can provide nothing in the way of comforting counsel. As photographed by the peerless Sven Nykvist, who spent a month studying how the light in the church that’s the film’s central location changed in the course of a day, Winter Light is a film of bleak beauty, a rigorously pared-down drama of the struggle to hold onto faith in the face of God’s silence.",

    "title": "Workingman's Death",
    "director": "Michael Glawogger",
    "year": "2005",
    "runtime": "122min",
    "synopsis": "Is it possible to make a post-apocalyptic movie set in the present day? Glawogger’s globe-spanning documentary panorama comes awfully close. Its vignettes of manual laborers at work reveal a world of grueling labor and Stygian landscapes, including illegal coal mines in the Ukraine, a sulfur mine in Indonesia, a Pakistani shipbreaking ground, and a slaughter yard in Nigeria. A litany of scenes of backbreaking toil and ecological devastation, suggesting that for many outside of the privileged west, the end of the world is already here.",
